                My background experience has a focus on managing, designing or 
                developing SaaS and PaaS products or project features 
                with freelance design experience creating modern UI expereinces. 
                I've worked with startups, major corporate 
                enterprises and small local businesses satisfying stakeholders 
                and reaching roadmap goals with proven results.

            I am exceptionally good at software project management from being a team 
            player and supporting members during tight bottleneck sprints helping 
            consistently optimize and adapt to the work-process, managing workflow 
            collaboratively.  By takeing pride in being a team player and focusing 
            on communication, organization, planning, following through with strategy, 
            holding people accountable, I have delivered results with accuracy and 
            reliability over and over again always looking for feedback and ways I can grow. 
            I work best with High-Level Managers and Developers by briding the gap between 
            technicality developers communicate with and breaking it down in generality. 
            Products or projects I've work on pertain to software-engineering, 
            cyber-security, cloud-computing, business-operations and marketing.
