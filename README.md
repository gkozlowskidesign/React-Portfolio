# ReadMe.GaryKozlowski

## Getting Started

This Readme document will discuss four separate phases of the build which are design, development, administration, and optimization. Each of these phases also has three sub-sections documentation, resources, and tools used during the gated steps process workflow.

## Project Management

### Design Phase

In the design phase, we will focus on creating a detailed plan for the project. This will include documenting our overall goals and objectives, as well as the specific features and functionality that we want to include. We will also identify any potential challenges or risks that we may face during the development process. To support the design phase, we will provide documentation outlining the design process and any relevant resources or tools that we used. This may include design prototypes, wireframes, and user flows.

### Development Phase

In the development phase, we will turn the design plan into a working product. This will involve writing code, implementing features, and conducting testing to ensure that the product meets our quality standards. To support the development phase, we will provide documentation outlining the development process and any relevant resources or tools that we used. This may include code repositories, bug-tracking systems, and testing frameworks.

### Administration Phase

In the administration phase, we will focus on managing and maintaining the product once it has been released. This will include tasks such as monitoring performance, handling user support requests, and implementing updates and fixes as needed. To support the administration phase, we will provide documentation outlining the administration process and any relevant resources or tools that we used. This may include monitoring tools, customer support systems, and deployment pipelines.

### Optimization Phase

In the optimization phase, we will focus on improving the performance and efficiency of the product. This may involve identifying and addressing bottlenecks, optimizing code, and implementing new features to improve the user experience.

To support the optimization phase, we will provide documentation outlining the optimization process and any relevant resources or tools that we used. This may include performance profiling tools, optimization guides, and feature planning documents.
